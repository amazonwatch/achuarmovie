alt_text: Walking with masato
---

Wherever they go, masato goes with them. Women accompany their husbands on hunting trips, carrying a pot of thick masato in a basket on their backs, which is mixed with stream water before serving. They also serve large amounts during all communal activities to keep the workers cheery and slightly tipsy, so that hard work is made easier and time flies by with joking and singing. And when the work is over they party into the night.
